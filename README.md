# HexMapBuilderVue

This is a tool to help RPG game masters generate maps for hex crawl or similar games.  Use this to generate terrain and contents, and then tailor it to your specific game.  The hex content this generates is intended as prompts for the GM, not as final content, and is system-independent.

Still very much a work in progress, but should be somewhat usable!
